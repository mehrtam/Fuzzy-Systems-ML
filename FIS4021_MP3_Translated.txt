### Problem 1: Fuzzy Systems for Function Approximation
- Design **two fuzzy systems** for approximation using the **upper and lower bounds of first-order and second-order relations** from [2] (pages 10-11 and 4-11, respectively).
- Approximate the function:

  g(x1, x2) = 1 / (3 + x1 + x2)

  over the domain **U = [−1, 1] × [−1, 1]** with an accuracy of **ϵ = 0.1**.
- Compare and plot the designed fuzzy systems.

### Problem 2: Table Lookup Search for Time-Series Prediction
- Implement a **table lookup search algorithm** for predicting the **Mackey-Glass time series**.
- Ensure your implementation supports empty table entries for a complete and versatile solution.
- Test and present the results in a suitable format, referencing section **12.3** of [2].

### Problem 3: Fuzzy System for Nonlinear System Identification
- Consider the given **difference equation-based nonlinear system**:

  y(k + 1) = 0.3y(k) + 0.6y(k − 1) + g[u(k)]

  where g[u(k)] is an unknown function defined as:

  g(u) = 0.6 sin(πu) + 0.3 sin(3πu) + 0.1 sin(5πu)

- Design a **fuzzy system** to approximate the unknown nonlinear component g[u(k)], utilizing **gradient descent learning**.
- Implement and validate the approximation using the equations (13.5, 13.8, 13.9) from [2].

### Problem 4: Decision Tree Implementation & Analysis
1. **Implement a Decision Tree Classifier from Scratch**
   - Do not use **Scikit-Learn** or any pre-built libraries.
   - Apply the model to a **COVID-19 dataset** and analyze the results.
   - If possible, extract additional insights from the decision tree output.
   - Provide logical analysis of the obtained results.

2. **Train Decision Tree Models Using Scikit-Learn**
   - Select one of the following datasets: **Drugs** or **Breast Cancer**.
   - Train and compare decision trees with different hyperparameters.
   - Analyze model performance using metrics such as **pruning techniques** and parameter tuning.

3. **(Optional)** Apply a decision tree classifier to the **Life Expectancy Dataset** and analyze the results.

### Problem 5 (Optional): Image Contrast Enhancement using Fuzzy Logic
- Traditional contrast enhancement methods like **Histogram Equalization** often lead to excessive contrast changes, reducing image quality.
- Develop a **fuzzy logic-based contrast enhancement system** to address these limitations.
- Implement and compare your approach with standard methods in terms of **quality metrics (PSNR, processing time, etc.)**.
- Refer to provided Colab notebooks and research papers for guidance.
